This project is a basic recipe website. It should demonstrate everything I have learned in the HTML section of the Foundations Course at The Odin Project.

Writing this as I finish the first project, I should review the material we covered on Git. I could have did better on my commit messages. I made a commit message for two things at once when I wanted to make a seperate one for each item I updated. Though it wasn't required in the instructions for this project, I added credit to the recipe authors at the end of each one because it only seemed right to do so.

Note to future self: USE GIT ADD AND COMMIT AS YOU GO! DO NOT WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE EDITED MULTIPLE FILES TO DO SO >:|
